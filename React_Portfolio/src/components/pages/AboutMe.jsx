        Hello!! Welcome to my Portfolio Page! My name is Brandon Gonzalez, I have recently enrolled into a bootcamp program through the University of San Diego for web development. 
        I am excited to showcase my skills and expertise on this personal web page as I continue through the course in the next six months. 
        I will be learning new web development techniques throughout my educational journey and implement them accordingly, I'm going to be updating my website as I grasp onto the role of a full-stack web developer. 
        I am only three weeks into my cyber voyage and look forward to all the challenges that lie ahead of me so that I can make a successful career change into the tech industry. 
        I am working my way through the fundamentals and aquiring the necessary steps to understand the basics and advanced techniques. I have always been a quick learner and wish to extend that skill into the web devlopment world by applying my efforts and understanding code.
